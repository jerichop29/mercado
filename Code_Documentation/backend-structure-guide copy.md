Backend File Structure Documentation (MVC)

Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the optimized backend file structure following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, explaining each directory's purpose, contents, and best practices.

Root Directory Structure

backend/
├── src/
│   ├── controllers/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── views/
│   ├── services/
│   └── helpers/
├── config/
├── public/
├── routes/
├── tests/
└── utils/

1. Source Directory (MVC Core)

src/
├── controllers/
├── models/
├── views/
├── services/
└── helpers/

Controllers Directory

Contains controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses

Processes user input, interacts with models, and selects views

Example: UserController.php, AuthController.php

Models Directory

Defines the application’s data structure and business logic

Interfaces with the database

Example: User.php, Post.php


Views Directory

Contains templates for rendering the UI

Example: user-profile.view.php, dashboard.view.php


Services Directory

Houses application logic that doesn’t belong in models or controllers

Handles authentication, email sending, and external API integrations

Example: AuthService.php, EmailService.php


Middleware Directory

Contains middleware for request processing

Handles authentication, logging, and CORS

Example: AuthMiddleware.php, LoggerMiddleware.php


Helpers Directory

Contains utility functions and common helpers

Example: StringFormatter.php, DateHelper.php

2. Config Directory

config/
├── database.php
└── constants.php

Purpose

Houses all configuration-related files

Centralizes environment-specific settings

Manages application constants

Components


database.php: Database connection settings


constants.php: Application-wide constants

3. Public Directory

public/
├── index.php
├── assets/
└── uploads/

Purpose

Web server's root directory

Stores publicly accessible files like images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files

Components

index.php: Main entry point for the application

assets/: Static resources (CSS, JS, images)

uploads/: User-uploaded files

4. Routes Directory

routes/
├── web.php
├── api.php
└── admin.php

Purpose

Defines application routes and their corresponding controllers

Components

web.php: Routes for web application

api.php: Routes for API endpoints

admin.php: Routes for admin panel

5. Tests Directory

tests/
├── unit/
├── integration/
└── fixtures/

Purpose

Contains all test-related files

Components

unit/: Unit tests for individual components

integration/: Tests for multiple components interacting together

fixtures/: Test data and setup files

6. Utils Directory

utils/
├── cache/
├── logs/
└── session/

Purpose

Stores temporary data such as logs, cache, and session files

Components

cache/: Cached data

logs/: Application logs

session/: Session storage files

Best Practices

1. File Naming Conventions

Use PascalCase for classes: UserController.php

Use camelCase for functions: handleUserLogin()

Use kebab-case for templates: user-profile.view.php

2. Directory Organization

Keep related files together

Maintain a shallow hierarchy (max 3-4 levels)

Group by feature when possible

3. Code Organization

One class per file

Consistent file extensions

Clear separation of concerns (Model, View, Controller)

4. Security Considerations

Keep sensitive files outside the web root

Use environment variables for credentials

Implement proper access controls

This MVC structure ensures a well-organized, scalable, and maintainable backend architecture.
